# Editify

Editify was made with the intention of becoming a universal file editor. The web application allows users to edit and save their files online. As of the moment, the site is made in Vanilla JS, and future improvements are to come. Editify has several functionalities, allowing for users to edit code (HTML/CSS/JS), images, videos, audio, and text files.
